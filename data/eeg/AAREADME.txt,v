Database: TUH Abnormal EEG Corpus
Version: v3.0.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you use this specific corpus in your research or technology
development, we ask that you reference the corpus using this
publication:

 Lopez, S. (2017). Automated Identification of Abnormal EEGs. 
 Temple University.

This publication can be retrieved from:

Our preferred reference for the TUH EEG Corpus, from which this
seizure corpus was derived, is:

 Obeid, I., & Picone, J. (2016). The Temple University Hospital EEG
 Data Corpus. Frontiers in Neuroscience, Section Neural Technology,
 10, 196. http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2016.00196.

This file contains information about the demographics and relevant
statistics for the TUH EEG Abnormal Corpus, which contains EEG records
that are classified as clinically normal or abnormal.

FILENAME STRUCTURE:

A typical filename in this corpus is:

 edf/eval/abnormal/01_tcp_ar/aaaaamye_s001_t000.edf

The first segment, "edf/", is a directory name for the directory containing
the data, which consists of edf files (*.edf).

The second segment denotes either the evaluation data ("/eval") or
the training data ("/train").

The third segment ("normal") denotes whether the EEG is "normal" or
"abnormal".

The fourth segment ("/01_tcp_ar") denotes the type of channel configuration
for the EEG. "/01_tcp_ar" refers to an AR reference configuration.
In this corpus there is only one type of configuration used.

The last segment is the filename ("aaaaamye_s001_t000.edf"). This
includes the subject identifier ("aaaaamye"), the session number
("s001") and a token number ("t000"). EEGs are split into a series of
files starting with *t000.edf, *t001.edf, ...  These represent pruned
EEGs, so the original EEG is split into these segments, and
uninteresting parts of the original recording were deleted (common in
clinical practice).

The *.edf contains the signal data.

DATABASE SUMMARY

This subset of TUH EEG is 60G in size:

 nedc_000_[1]: du -sLBM edf
 59995M	edf

It contains 2,993 *.edf files.

SUBJECT, SESSION AND FILE STATISTICS:

The subject statistics are summarized in the table below:

Subjects:

 |----------------------------------------------|
 | Description |  Normal  | Abnormal |  Total   |
 |-------------+----------+----------+----------|
 | Evaluation  |      148 |      105 |      253 |
 |-------------+----------+----------+----------|
 | Train       |    1,237 |      893 |    2,130 |
 |-------------+----------+----------+----------|
 | Total       |    1,385 |      998 |    2,383 |
 |----------------------------------------------|
 
It is important to note that (1) there is no overlap between subjects
in the evaluation and training sets, (2) subjects only appear once in
the evaluation set as either normal or abnormal (but not both), and
(3) some subjects appear more than once in the training set.

Therefore, there are 253 unique subjects in the evaluation set, but
only 2,076 unique subjects in the training set. Hence, there are 54
subjects that appear as both normal and abnormal in the training
set. This was a conscious design decision as we wanted some examples
of subjects who demonstrated both morphologies.
 
Subjects can have multiple sessions. Below is a table describing the
distribution of sessions:

Sessions:

 |----------------------------------------------|
 | Description |  Normal  | Abnormal |  Total   |
 |-------------+----------+----------+----------|
 | Evaluation  |      150 |      126 |      276 |
 |-------------+----------+----------+----------|
 | Train       |    1,371 |    1,346 |    2,717 |
 |-------------+----------+----------+----------|
 | Total       |    1,521 |    1,472 |    2,993 |
 |----------------------------------------------|

More than one session from a subject appears in this database. We
selected files/sessions based on their relevance to the
normal/abnormal detection problem - whether they display some
challenging or interesting behavior. However, unlike v1.0.0, the
evaluation set and training set are 100% disjoint - no subject
appears in both partitions.

Most of the subjects in the evaluation set appear once (average
number of sessions per subject is 1.09), while subjects in the
training set have an average of 1.28 sessions.

Some basic statistics on the number of files and the number of hours
of data are given below:

Size (No. of Files / Hours of Data):

 |----------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Description |      Normal      |     Abnormal     |      Total       |
 |-------------+------------------+------------------+------------------|
 | Evaluation  |   150 (   55.46) |   126 (   47.48) |   276 (  102.94) |
 |-------------+------------------+------------------+------------------|
 | Train       | 1,371 (  512.01) | 1,346 (  526.05) | 2,717 (1,038.06) |
 |-------------+------------------+------------------+------------------|
 | Total       | 1,521 (  567.47) | 1,472 (  573.53) | 2,993 (1,142.00) |
 |----------------------------------------------------------------------|

Only one file from each session was included in this corpus. It is
important to point out that each EEG session is comprised of several
EDF files (the records are pruned before they are stored in the
database).  A single file was selected from a session - typically the
longest file in the session. We did not include multiple files from
the same session. So the number of files and number of sessions are
identical.

Each file selected from a session was chosen by considering the
length of the file (all the files in this corpus are longer than 15
minutes) and/or the presence of relevant activity.

INTER-RATER AGREEMENT:

A summary of the distribution of normal/abnormal EEGs is shown below:

 |-----------------------------------------------------------|

In our v3.0.0 release, we manually reviewed the data to determine the
extent to which our assessments were in agreement with the associated
EEG reports. The outcome of this analysis was as follows:

Evaluation:

 |---------------------------------------------------|
 | Description         |    Files     |   Subjects   |
 |---------------------+--------------+--------------|
 | Positive Agreement* |   276 (100%) |   254 (100%) |
 |---------------------+--------------+--------------|
 | Negative Agreement* |     0 (  0%) |     0 (  0%) |
 |---------------------------------------------------|

Train:

 |---------------------------------------------------|
 | Description         |    Files     |   Subjects   |
 |---------------------+--------------+--------------|
 | Positive Agreement* | 2,700 ( 99%) | 2,110 ( 97%) |
 |---------------------+--------------+--------------|
 | Negative Agreement* |    27 (  1%) |    21 (  1%) |
 |---------------------------------------------------|

Our annotators made their decisions based on evidence in the signal
for the specific segment chosen. The EEG report contains a finding
based on the subject history and overall EEG session.

DEMOGRAPHICS:

This section contains general information about the subjects' age and
gender. It is important to point out that the information is reported
by subject. Since the data spans over several years, some subjects
might be represented more than once (with different ages) in the age
section.

time (often years), below is a distribution of age by session:
